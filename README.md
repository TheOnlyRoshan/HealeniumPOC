# Healenium Selenium Web Automation Framework

A clean, production-ready **Java + Selenium 4** web automation framework using **Healenium** for self-healing locators.  
Built to reduce flaky UI test failures caused by minor DOM changes while enforcing solid automation discipline.

This is **not** a demo framework. It is structured for real-world CI usage.
